            <p>If you are a newbie in the field of software development, the very first question comes to your mind is
                “Where to begin?” That’s undoubtedly true!</p>
            <p>There are hundreds to choose from, but how will you discover that yes, that’s the one? Which will be
                most suitable for you, your interests and career goals?</p>
            <p>One of the easiest ways to pick the best programming language to learn for 2019 is by listening to what
                the market says, where the tech trend is going…</p>
            <p>
                Data Type of Programming

            <p>It seems impossible to be a software developer these days without using JavaScript. The first one in the
                list is JavaScript, it seems impossible to imagine software development without JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p> Example:
                <code>
function first(param) {
    alert("Hello " + param);
}
greetMe("World");
</code>
            </p>
            <p>Primarily, JavaScript is light weighed, intercodeted and plays a major role in front-end development.
                Even
                some of the major social media platforms believe that JavaScript provides an easy way to create
                interactive web pages smoothly and is career-driven.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is most codeferred because of its compatibility with all the major browsers and is really
                flexible with the syntax it holds. Being a Front-end language, JavaScript is also used on the
                server-side through Node.js.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Python">
            <header>Python</header>
            <p>This may surprise you; I have kept python on number #2, in many of the surveys it is positioned on number
                #5. But, I will definitely let you believe, here’s why?</p>
            <p>Python is one of the general purpose, user-friendly programming language here on my list. What makes it
                so? Like Java, Python syntax is clear, intuitive and almost similar to the English language. Python’s
                “object-based” subset is somewhere similar to JavaScript.</p>


            <code>print("Hello, World!")
output: Hello, World!</code>


            <p>According to Stack Overflow, there is one section which says “To be adopted or migrated to be—or to
                migrate too soon”, and for python, it’s 12% which is highest. Broadly, people who have migrated to
                python are close to 42%, which signifies it to be at number #2.</p>
            <p>f you are interested in making your career in back-end development, like Django – Open source framework,
                is written in python, which makes it easy to learn and feature-packed, yet popular. Also, python has a
                variety of applications that make it a versatile and powerful.

        <section class="main-section" id="Java">
            <header>Java</header>
            <p>If anybody asks why java, most frequent sentence comes up would be “write once, run everywhere” – Java
                has been the ruling programming language for the last 20 years. Java is 99% object-oriented and is
                robust as java objects contain no references to data external to themselves. It is simpler than C++
                because Java uses automatic memory allocation and garbage collection.</p>

            <code>/* This is a simple Java program.
class HelloWorld
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}</code>

            <p>Java is highly cross-platform compatible or platform independent. Since you can code anywhere (I mean on
                all devices), compile into low-level machine code, and finally, execute on any platform using JVM – Java
                Virtual Machine (which is platform dependent).</p>
            <p>Java forms the base for the Android operating system and opted around 90% fortune 500 companies for
                making a variety of back-end applications. I would not hesitate for taking the biggest sensation Apache
                Hadoop data processing, run by Amazon Web Services and Windows Azure.</p>

            <header>C or Cpp</header>
            <p>“Old is gold” – C has proved this quote in different ways. Being introduced in the late 1970s, C has made
                a strong contribution to the world of programming.</p>
            <p>C has been the parent language of a handful; some are either derived from C or inspired by its syntax,
                constructs, and paradigms, including Java, Objective-C, and C#.</p>
            <p>Even, nowadays, it is seen, whenever there is a need to build high-performance applications, C remains
                the most popular choice.</p>
            <p>Linux OS is C based. And CPP is the hybrid version of C. C++ is an object-oriented programming language
                and which is built on C; therefore it is codeferred over others for designing higher-level applications.

            <p>PHP stands for Hypertext codeprocessor, is a general-purpose programming language. Clearly, PHP is
                a
                scripting language, which runs on a server, and it is used to create web pages written in HTML.
                It
                is popular because it is free, cheap, easy to set up and simple to use for new programmers.</p>
            <p>PHP is a very strong option for web developers around the globe. It is widely used to create
                dynamic
                web page content, and images used on websites. It’s hitting on number #5 because of its broad
                range
                of usage. Also, PHP is well dressed for Wordcodess CMS (Content Management System).

            <p>C-sharp is a powerful, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft in 2000. C-sharp
                is utilized in developing desktop applications and more recently, Windows 8/10 applications and

            <p>Microsoft developed C# as a rival to Java. Actually, Sun did not want the interference of Microsoft
                to make changes in Java. So, it was created.</p>
            <p>C# has a variety of features which makes it easier to learn for the beginners. The code is
                consistent, and logical as compared to C++.</p>

            <p>Next on the list is Swift. As smooth as its name, Swift is a general-purpose, open-source, compiled
                programming language developed by Apple Inc. If you are looking develop to native iOS or Mac OS apps
                then, Swift is barely needed for its development. </p>
            <code>import Swift
print("Hello, World!")
                    </code>
            <p>Swift is deeply influenced by Python and Ruby and was designed to be beginner-friendly and fun to
                use. Swift is considered to be a faster, more secure, and easier to read and debug than its
                codedecessor Objective-C.</p>
            <p>CUnlike Objective-C, Swift requires less code, resembles with natural English. Hence, it becomes
                easier for existing techies from JavaScript, Java, Python, C#, and C++ to switch to Swift without
                hassle.</p>

            <p>An open source, dynamic programming language, focused on simplicity and productivity, developed in
                mid-1990 in Japan. It was designed with themed of simplifying the programming environment and making

            <code>puts "Please enter your name."
name = gets
puts "Hi, #{name}! I'm Ruby!"
                </code>
            <p>Ruby becomes popular by Ruby on Rails framework, a full-stack web framework. Ruby has dynamically typed
                language, it does not have hard rules and it is a high-level language which resembles with the English
                language to a great extent.</p>
            <p>In short, you can build an application with less line of code. But the challenge of Ruby is being
                dynamically typed language, it’s not easy to maintain and its flexibility makes it’s slow.</p>
